# Codelab - General Purpose Repository

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to keep codes created during the training with [Jagaad Academy](https://academy.jagaad.com/) and experimenting with different concepts, patterns and paradigms, mostly related to the backend, but also might appear some snippets closer to the infrastructure and frontend.  
It is not intended to evolve to a status of a separate project and to be published independently, but might become a useful resource for other particular projects development or a starting point for development of a small framework in the future.
