        <h2>Codelab - a General Purpose Repository</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this repository is to keep codes created during my training with
            <a href="https://academy.jagaad.com/" class="external">Jagaad Academy</a> and experimenting with different concepts,
            patterns and paradigms, mostly related to the backend, but also might appear some snippets closer to the infrastructure and frontend.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not intended to evolve to a status of a separate project and to be published independently,
            but might become a useful resource for other particular projects development or a starting point
            for development of a small framework in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be continued ... :)
